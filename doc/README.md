#### Here we have documented some procedures performed during our work

- Differences found between Landsat images downloaded from __USGS__ and images obtained using the __landsat_utils__ python module ([tree.md](tree.md)).  
We performed a __landsat_utils__ --> __USGS__ transformation by changing the filenames and modifying the metadata (renaming and adding properties).
